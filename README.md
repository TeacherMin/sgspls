Sparse group-subgroup PLS
=========================

`sgspls` is an R package that provides an implementation of an alternating convex search algorithm for computing partial least squares solutions with multiple grouping levels. Most of the linear algebra is written in C++ using [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org) and the [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net) C++ library. 

A preliminary paper has been submitted describing the statistical properties of the sparse group-subgroup PLS with grouping structure and will be made avaliable when the manuscript is accepted.
